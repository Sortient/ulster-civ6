# Ulster Civilization VI mod

This is a repository for my mod, which adds John Hume as a leader of Northern Ireland/Ulster to Civ VI. It is based on maconnolly's Olmec template, is very much a work in progress, and currently is only compatible with R&F *AND* GS.

# Key Features
- The Civ ability is *Linenopolis*. Industrial Zones provide a culture bomb, and Luxury Resources provide +3 production.
- John Hume's leader ability is *Good Friday Agreement*. He cannot declare Holy Wars, and cities receive +10% culture and +10% science for each religion that is different from Ulster's founded religion.
- The mod features custom music, with renditions of Danny Boy/Londonderry Air providing background atmosphere to the game.

# Future Aspirations
- Add a secondary leader - most likely Hugh O'Neill, Earl of Tyrone
- Add loyalty flip overlay
- Update Linenopolis to provide diplomatic favour
